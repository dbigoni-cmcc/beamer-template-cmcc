## What is this and who is it for 🤷‍♀️

This project was made for learning purposes. I wanted to learn how to make Beamer template. It was inspired by this stack exchange answer by Claudio Fiandrino https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/146682.


## Development 🚀

Compile `scratch-example.tex` with `pdflatex scratch-example.tex`.

## Known bugs 🐛

- Long presentation title will overflow over subtitle
- Frame title should be vertically centerd is blue box when title is defined for a frame but subtitle is not
